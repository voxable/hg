**NB: This gem is still under heavy development, and is likely going to change wildly between releases. You probably shouldn't use it quite yet. [Follow Voxable](https://www.voxable.io/blog) and we'll let you know when it's ready!**

Hg is a conversational interface framework for Ruby on Rails. It dramatically simplifies the process of building voice interfaces and chatbots for a variety of messaging platforms.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hg'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hg
    
### Configuration
Create an initializer file within your Rails app at `config/initializers/bot.rb`
    

## Usage

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
